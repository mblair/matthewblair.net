Hi, I'm Matt Blair, and this is my little corner of the Internet.

I live in Long Beach, California with my wife, [Morgan Brunelle](https://www.morganbrunelle.com) and a lot of animals. I was born in 1987 in Brooklyn, New York, grew up on Long Island, and moved to California in 2011.

I'm a very avid home cook and [cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/mattyblair).

In order to fund these habits, I work on security infrastructure at [Google](https://www.google.com). Previously, I was an early engineer at [Figma](https://www.figma.com). Prior to that, I spent five years at [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com), eventually leading the site reliability engineering team. Before that, I attended Cornell University and Stony Brook University's Southampton campus, where I met my wife.

A couple of my recorded technical talks from ages ago are online; one was at [HBaseCon](https://vimeo.com/128194533), and the other was at a [RethinkDB meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ScLnROJ-iU). I was also on [a panel](https://figma.splashthat.com/) on mentorship for underrepresented folks in the technology industry.
