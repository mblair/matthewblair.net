Hi, I'm Matt Blair, and this is my little corner of the Internet.

I live in San Francisco, California with my wife, [Morgan Brunelle](https://www.morganbrunelle.com) and a lot of other animals. I was born in 1987 in Brooklyn, New York, grew up on Long Island, and moved to California in 2011.

I turn coffee into computer programs at [Figma](https://www.figma.com). Previously, I spent five years at [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com), eventually leading the site reliability engineering team. Before that, I attended Cornell University and Stony Brook University's Southampton campus, where I met my wife.

I program as a hobby outside of work. I also like to run, bike, ski, snowshoe, ice skate, listen to [progressive trance music](https://soundcloud.com/matthewblair/likes), and read science fiction. My other interests are pretty well captured on [my Flipboard profile](https://flipboard.com/@mb) and [my Twitter timeline](https://twitter.com/mattyblair).

A couple of my recorded technical talks are online; one was at [HBaseCon](https://vimeo.com/128194533), and the other was at a [RethinkDB meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ScLnROJ-iU).
